📘 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of essential database concepts, including relational vs. flat file databases, DBMS advantages, database roles, and advanced research topics like database engines, cloud storage, and schema design.

✅ Comparison Assignments

🔷 What is a Flat File?

A flat file stores data in plain text format, organized as a single table with no relationships between tables.

🔷 What is a Relational Database?

A relational database organizes data into tables that are related through primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.

📊 Difference Between Relational Database and Flat File

📌 Aspect

Relational Database

Flat File

Structure

Multiple tables, rows, columns

Single table or text file

Redundancy

Low (Normalization applied)

High (Data repetition)

Relationships

Supported via keys

Not supported

Use Cases

Enterprise systems, analytics

Small apps, simple storage

Drawbacks

Requires DBMS, complex setup

Not scalable, hard to query

🧠 DBMS Advantages Mind Map

✅ Data Security

✅ Data Integrity

✅ Data Sharing

✅ Backup and Recovery

✅ Efficient Data Management

🛠️ Roles in a Database System

Database Administrator: Manages database maintenance, backup, and security.

Database Designer: Develops data models, schemas, and relationships.

Database Developer: Implements database queries, procedures, and optimizations.

System Analyst: Defines data requirements and workflows.

Application Developer: Connects databases to applications through coding.

BI Developer: Extracts insights using data analysis and reporting tools.
